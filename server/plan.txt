Step 1: Listen for incoming connection request. Respond with a Hello World when established.

First step: Create an active connect (maybe socket) that listens for incoming requests

Step 2: Find way to authenticate that request

Step 3: Allow for requests to change file contents and regulate the files that are edited (prevent user to edit or restrict viewing files outside the allowed).
